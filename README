Play 2.2 application
=====================================

- Reactive single-page app using angularJS and websockets.
- Websocket io handled server-side by Akka actors
- Backed by redis, an in-memory key value store
- Fully nonblocking (modulo a few Await.result(future_x) calls used to conform to an outside API's type signatures)
