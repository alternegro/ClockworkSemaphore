<h2>Introduction</h2>

This project is an implementation of the Redis-based Twitter clone described in <a href="http://redis.io/topics/twitter-clone">this case study</a>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<b>"</b> In this article I'll describe the design and implementation of a simple clone of Twitter written using PHP with Redis as the only database.
The programming community has traditionally considered key-value stores as a special purpose database that couldn't be used as a drop in replacement
for a relational database for the development of web applications. This article will try to correct this impression.
Our Twitter clone, called Retwis, is structurally simple, has very good performance, and can be distributed among any number of web and Redis servers with very little effort. <b>"</b>

I encourage you to read the above case study, which describes the redis schema used in detail.
The following tutorial pages contain links to the major components of this app, with short descriptions of their role.
The bulk of the documentation is inline, in the form of comments.

<div>
<h2>Main page</h2>


Users can view their personal feed, view the global feed, post tweets and favorite/unfavorite other users from here. This page is made up of several components.

<br>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#code/app/views/app/index.scala.html" class="shortcut">index.scala.html</a>:
    presentation layer of the main page. Uses AngularJS bindings to encapsulate presentation logic.
</li>
<li>
<a href="#code/public/javascripts/main.js" class="shortcut">main.js</a>:
    AngularJS controller for the main page.
</li>
<li>
<a href="#code/app/actors/SocketActor.scala" class="shortcut">SocketActor.scala</a>:
    Akka actor which handles the server side of the Websocket connection.
    Uses Redis PubSub to listen for tweets of interest to users with active websocket connections.
</li>
<li>
<a href="#code/app/controllers/App.scala" class="shortcut">App.scala</a>:
    controller which constructs and serves the main page to authorized users.
</li>
<li>
<a href="#code/app/controllers/Websocket.scala" class="shortcut">Websocket.scala</a>:
    controller which provides a Websocket connection to authorized users.
</li>
<li>
<a href="#code/app/controllers/Api.scala" class="shortcut">Api.scala</a>:
    controller which handles API requests from authorized users to follow and un-follow other users.
</li>
<li>
<a href="#code/app/controllers/Auth.scala" class="shortcut">Auth.scala</a>:
    Request builders used to ensure only authorized users can access the above components. Encapsulates authorization logic.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Landing page</h2>

Users without authorization cookies are redirected to this static page, where they can either login to their existing accounts or register a new account.

<br>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#code/app/controllers/LandingPage.scala" class="shortcut">LandingPage.scala</a>:
    controller which handles login, logout and registration.
</li>
<li>
<a href="#code/app/views/app/landing.scala.html" class="shortcut">landing.scala.html</a>:
    static html page which handles login and registration.
</li>
</ul>


</div>


<div>
<h2>
Redis
</h2>

The Redis service provides nonblocking interaction with Redis.

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="#code/app/service/RedisService.scala" class="shortcut">RedisService.scala</a>:
        Global object which encapsulates interaction with Redis. All methods are fully nonblocking.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#code/app/service/RedisSchema.scala" class="shortcut">RedisSchema.scala</a>:
        Base trait containing strings used as Redis keys and functions for converting domain objects (UserId, PostId, etc.) into Redis keys.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#code/app/service/RedisConfig.scala" class="shortcut">RedisConfig.scala</a>:
        Base trait which encapsulates Redis configuration and initialization of Redis clients.
    </li>
</ul>

</div>
